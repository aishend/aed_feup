- **combinatorial_games_2/**: Implementations of combinatorial games, sequences, and related challenges.
- **search_algorithms_3/**: Binary search, lower bound, closest sum, and other search algorithms.
- **sorting_algorithms_4/**: Sorting algorithms, tournaments, and examples of custom sorting.
- **linked_lists_5/**: Implementations of singly linked lists and related data structures.
- **stl_containers_6/**: Examples using STL containers like lists, with games and utilities.
- **list_operations_7/**: Advanced operations on lists, including round-robin algorithms and games.
- **advanced_data_structures_8/**: Advanced topics in data structures.

## Usage

Each folder contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) and sometimes input/output files (`.txt`). To compile and run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output < input.txt
```

## Contributing

This is a personal repository for practice exercises. Feel free to explore and learn from the implementations.
